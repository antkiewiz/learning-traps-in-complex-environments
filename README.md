# Learning Traps in Complex Environments

Selective attention to relevant stimuli enhances learning efficiency. However, learning traps may arise when attention prematurely narrows on a subset of relevant features, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This process has been previously studied using simplified experimental paradigms, which make it difficult to apply findings to real-world settings. This project aimed to investigate how one characteristic of real-world settings - their complexity - can impact development of learning traps.
